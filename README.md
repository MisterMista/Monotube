# Monotube
Stay focused on YouTube by removing suggested videos, so you can watch what you need and get out. This is a personal project that was made because I got tired of continuously clicking on random videos in the recommended list and wasting all my time.

## TODO
 - Create an icon
 - Add browser action badge that shows total time on YouTube for a certain amount of time (per day, per week, etc)
 - Add dark mode
